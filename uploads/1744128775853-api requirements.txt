1. System Architecture & Portals
The system will be divided into five main portals based on the roles and their permissions:
1. Student Portal – For submitting contributions (articles, images).
2. Faculty Marketing Coordinator Portal – For reviewing and selecting contributions.
3. University Marketing Manager Portal – For overseeing the entire magazine selection process.
4. Admin Portal – For managing system configurations (closure dates, accounts, etc.).
5. Guest Portal – For public users to view selected articles.
Each portal will have role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure security and restricted access to relevant data.

Additional coursework requirements – release week 6 1. 
To improve security the system needs to remind every user of the date and time they last logged in (or welcome them if this is their first login) 
2. To monitor the use of the system the administrator needs to be able to view a number of reports showing which pages are most viewed, which users are most active, which browsers are being used, etc. 


3. When a guest account is registered for each faculty, the system emails a notification to the Faculty’s Marketing Coordinator. 
4. Faculty’s Marketing Coordinators can view the list of guests in their faculty. ========================================================================
